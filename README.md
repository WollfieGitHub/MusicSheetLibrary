# MusicSheetLibrary

Instead of searching for music sheets in your file folder, creates a visual interface for all your music sheets, with customizable metadata such as, but not limited to :
- Artist
- Instrument
- Genre
- Category (Video Game, Movie, ...)

Search for music sheets pdfs can be made using these metadata and music sheets can be linked to Musescore files
